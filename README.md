## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Predict behavior to retain customers. You can analyze all relevant customer data anddevelop focused customer retention programs.
In other words, create a model that is able to predict customers that will churn

For this project, we will evaluate several classification models and choose the one which best suits our needs.

We would also be logging this experiment on comet ML to help keep track and monitor several versions of the project. Click [here](https://www.comet.ml/othuke/customer-churn) to access the project on comet_ml
